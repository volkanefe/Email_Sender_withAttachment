In this code, the MIMEText object is created with 'html' as the second argument, 
indicating that the email body is in HTML format. The body variable is inserted 
into an HTML template to form the html_body variable, which is then attached to the email.

Make sure to replace "your_email@gmail.com" and "your_password" with your actual 
email address and password. Also, provide the correct paths for the attachment 
file and the CSV file containing the list of recipients. The body variable can be updated 
with your desired HTML content for the email body.
